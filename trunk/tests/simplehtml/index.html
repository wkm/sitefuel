        <h1>HTML and CSS deployment test for <span class='l'>site<span class='f'>fuel</span></span></h1>
        <p>
            This is a baseline test of the HTML and CSS deployment modules
            in sitefuel.
        </p>

        <h2>Testing tweakers</h2>
        <h3>Dashes</h3>
        <p>
            This tests the dash tweaker. Sentences separated by triple
            dashes---like so---should be nicely converted into em dashes.
            Similarly, number separated by double dashes---like 50--60---should
            be nicely converted into en dashes.
        </p>

        <h3>Quotes</h3>
        <p>
            The various quotes should be made into their appropriate, side
            dependent form.
        </p>
        <p>
            Single quotes: Richard said 'Hi!'.
        </p>
        <p>
            Double quotes: Richard said "Hi!".
        </p>
        <p>
            Apostrophes: This is Richard's car.
        </p>

        <h3>Arrows</h3>
        <p>
            Arrows are converted as well:
        </p>
        <p>
            a --> b, a ---> b, a ==> b, a ===> b,<br>
            a <-- b, a <--- b, a <== b, a <=== b,<br>
        </p>
