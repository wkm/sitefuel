# == Synopsis
#
# SiteFuel is a program and lightweight Ruby API for processing the
# source code behind your static and dynamic websites. SiteFuel can
# remove comments and unneeded whitespace from your CSS, HTML, and
# JavaScript files (as well as fragments in RHTML and PHP) files. It can
# also loss-lessly compress your PNG and JPEG images. SiteFuel can also
# deploy your website from SVN or GIT.
#
# Support for more file formats and repositories is planned for future
# versions.
#
#
# == Usage
#
#  sitefuel <command> [--scm=file|svn|git] <source> [<output>] [--debug] \
#           [--verbose]
#           [--help]
#           [--license]
#
# === <command>
# Possible commands are:
# pull:       Pulls a website from an SCM into a temporary directory.
# stage::     Simulate a deployment of a site.
# deploy::    Deploy a site using SiteFuel.
# process::   Deploy a website in-place. Not recommended.
# help::      Show this message.
#
# === <driver>
# SiteFuel can typically guess what driver to use, but you can explicitly
# specify:
#
# filesystem::  deploy a directory
# svn::         use with Subversion repositories
# git::         use with Git repositories
#
# === <source>
# Specify the source SiteFuel is deploying from. This should accept all
# protocols supported by enabled drivers. Eg.
#
# For svn:
#  svn+ssh://user@sitefuel.org/svn/web/sitefuel-main
#
# For git:
#  ssh://user@sitefuel.org/...
#
# === <output>
# Specify the directory into which SiteFuel is to deploy. Currently SiteFuel can
# only deploy into the file system.
#
# === --debug
# Enables all messages including debugging. This will give you a blow by blow
# account of what SiteFuel is doing.
#
# === --verbose
# Enables most messages. This will give you a relatively detailed account of
# how SiteFuel is deploying your site.
#
#
# == Examples
# Process an already deployed site:
#  sitefuel deploy /var/www/sitefuel /var/www/sitefuel-compacted
#
# Deploy a site from SVN:
#  sitefuel deploy svn+ssh://sitefuel.org/svn/tags/21 /var/www/
